### A HTML, CSS, and Javascript project. 
<hr>

<p>
     This was a slider JavaScript project, I created just to test my skills in html, css, and JS. 
A few images of cars have been added to the project. 
Using a image of a arrow i created buttons that would allow you to click them. When clicked it slides the picture left or right depending what direction you click. 
I have also included buttons under the frame, that also allow you to click them. 
Using a for loop. I gave each photo a index and displayed a button at the bottom. When clicked it will display a different photo.
